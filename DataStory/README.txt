Audience and Design Choices

For this data story about COVID test results and vaccinations, the audience is designed to be very specific - the Communications Director for the Philadelphia Department of Public Health. This data story is designed as an internal memo, written from the perspective of me as an imaginary analyst with the department who wants to use data to drive messaging to the general public. 

The Communications Director would care about effective and accurate messaging, realistic strategies given the resources of the department and the city, and public outreach that does not invoke any sort of legal liability on the city's behalf or public panic. While the Communications Director would not be the only stakeholder involved - other members of the department such as the Health Commissioner, Chief Operating Officer, and Information Technology Director would also likely play a role in signing off on the recommendations - the basis of this story is using data to drive public outreach and how current data collection and limitations impedes that. 

The Communications Director will already be well aware of the history of COVID in Philadelphia - he has been with the department since 2018. He will likely also be aware of the statistics surrounding testings and vaccines. However, the goal of this piece is to put the lack of data along with what we do know about positive results generally rising in the fall and winter together to raise awareness for the potential risk in Winter 2023-2024. 

The general public has largely moved on from COVID, and the virus itself is less severe than it was previously. But it's still disruptive and there are basic steps that Philadelphians can take to limit the spread of COVID. While the public may be somewhat apathetic, the main takeaway for the Communications Director from this analysis is that the department should ramp up outreach, messaging, and partnerships with local institutions to encourage residents to take basic precautions around the holidays. Additionally and with the help of the IT Department, some form of self reporting should be implemented on the website, which will also require public communication to encourage the public to provide at-home test results. 

This data story is designed to build the case of both poor data and more severe winter positive test results, with a sequential build up of what the city has reported historically, the drop off or lack of public data in test result collections and vaccinations, and historically worse winter periods. Throughout the memo, the goal is to remind the Communications Director of why it matters - disruptions to health and the economy, hospitalizations leading to death, and for more sentimental reasons, impacts to the holiday season which coincides with people congregating indoors. Data visualizations are kept relatively simple but are designed to reinforce gaps in data reporting and highlight areas of concern, such as lower vaccination areas on the map and the disparities between years and seasons for total testing and positive results. 

The memo is designed to be short for a quick read through given that the Communications Director is likely very busy, with data visualizations that can stand alone at a glance and recommendations separated out with key terms in bold at the bottom. It's also designed as more of a traditional memo. The data story is not meant to break new ground but reinforce what the Communications Director likely already knows - COVID is still disruptive, but we should not drop off on our public messaging about precautions even if the public health emergency is over.
